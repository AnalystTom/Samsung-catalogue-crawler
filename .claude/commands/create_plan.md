> CREATE specs/draft1.md draft the plan that: 
fetches fresh listings from multiple UK property portals, (b) filters them to the exact Brighton & Hove, price, and July-2025 availability constraints, and (c) appends new matches to a rolling CSV data-set each day.

Break the plan into these
sections: High Level Objective. mid level objective, low level tasks (what functions, classes need to be created), implementation notes, context (what files needs to be created), self validation and readme clean.

Research how to best sites like zoopla, rightmove in order to scrape the information from them and output it in a csv file with: 
1. link to the posting
2. price per month
3. avaiable from date
